**Goal:** Paid pilot discussion  
**Personalization:** 2-3 lines maximum  

```
Subject: Reducing auction & procurement risk at {{CompanyName}}

Hi {{FirstName}},

I'm reaching out because {{CompanyName}} operates auctions / procurement where auditability, transparency, and speed directly impact outcomes.

We've built enterprise-grade auction infrastructure already live in production — supporting live, timed, and tender auctions, with full audit trails and compliance controls.

Instead of a generic demo, we usually start with a 30–60 day paid pilot (₹50K–₹1L) focused on risk reduction and operational transparency, not features.

If improving control, compliance, or recovery speed is a priority this quarter, I'd welcome a short discussion.

Best,
{{Your Name}}
Founder, QuickMela

### ✅ **Personalization Examples**
```yaml
# For Manufacturing Companies
"I noticed {{CompanyName}} recently expanded production capacity in {{Location}} - this often creates equipment surplus challenges."

"Saw your recent sustainability report - efficient asset liquidation aligns perfectly with those goals."

# For Financial Institutions
"With the RBI's focus on stressed asset resolution, {{CompanyName}} likely needs more transparent recovery processes."

"Your quarterly report mentioned improving operational efficiency - auction modernization typically delivers 25%+ improvements."
```

## 🥈 **TEMPLATE 2 — INDUSTRIAL MANUFACTURING ANGLE**

**Use for:** Procurement / Operations / Asset teams  
**Goal:** Equipment liquidation + procurement efficiency  

```
Subject: Faster, auditable equipment auctions for {{CompanyName}}

Hi {{FirstName}},

Many manufacturing teams struggle with manual liquidation processes, low bidder participation, and audit complexity.

QuickMela provides real-time, auditable auction infrastructure used for equipment liquidation and procurement auctions, with role-based controls and full logs.

We engage via a paid pilot so teams can validate results without long-term commitment.

Would it make sense to explore this for one controlled auction scenario?

Regards,
{{Your Name}}
```

### ✅ **Industry-Specific Pain Points**
```yaml
# Manufacturing Pain Points to Reference
Equipment Surplus:
  - "Production line upgrades create surplus equipment"
  - "Seasonal demand changes leave idle machinery"
  - "Plant closures require rapid asset recovery"

Procurement Inefficiency:
  - "Manual supplier selection lacks competitive bidding"
  - "Procurement cycles take 60-90 days instead of 30"
  - "Audit trails for purchases are incomplete"

Compliance Requirements:
  - "Internal auditors demand complete auction transparency"
  - "GST compliance requires detailed transaction records"
  - "Board reporting needs real-time auction visibility"
```

## 🥉 **TEMPLATE 3 — FINANCIAL INSTITUTION / NBFC ANGLE**

**Use for:** Asset recovery, stressed assets  
**Goal:** Security + compliance + recovery optimization  

```
Subject: Secure, compliant asset auctions — without operational risk

Hi {{FirstName}},

Asset recovery auctions demand security, compliance, and zero ambiguity — especially when regulators and auditors are involved.

QuickMela is a production-ready auction platform built for secure asset auctions, real-time bidding, and post-auction audit defensibility.

We typically start with a paid pilot to validate compliance, speed, and recovery outcomes.

Open to a brief discussion if this aligns with your recovery goals.

Best,
{{YourName}}

### ✅ **Financial Institution Pain Points**
```yaml
# Banking/NBFC Pain Points to Reference
Stressed Asset Recovery:
  - "NPA resolution requires transparent auction processes"
  - "RBI auditors demand complete bid documentation"
  - "Current recovery rates are 30-40% below market potential"

Regulatory Compliance:
  - "Asset auction processes need RBI compliance validation"
  - "Audit trails must withstand regulatory scrutiny"
  - "Transparency requirements are increasing"

Operational Efficiency:
  - "Manual auction processes take 4-6 weeks"
  - "Limited bidder participation reduces recovery rates"
  - "Documentation errors delay recovery timelines"
```

## 🔁 **TEMPLATE 4 — FOLLOW-UP (DAY 4–5)**

**Use if:** No reply to initial outreach  
**Goal:** Gentle reminder + easy opt-out  

```
Subject: Re: auction transparency at {{CompanyName}}

Hi {{FirstName}},

Just following up — this is relevant if audit confidence, transparency, or faster auction outcomes are priorities right now.

Happy to step aside if timing isn't right.

Best,
{{YourName}}
```

### ✅ **Follow-Up Variations**
```yaml
# Day 8-9 Follow-Up (Second follow-up)
Subject: Re: {{CompanyName}} auction efficiency

Hi {{FirstName}},

One last check — if improving auction control, compliance, or recovery speed isn't a priority, I'll close this thread.

If it is, we can discuss a focused 30-day pilot.

Best,
